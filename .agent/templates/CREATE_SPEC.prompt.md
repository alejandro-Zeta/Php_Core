Using PHP Core Agent-Safe v1.0.0,

Your task is to CREATE A SPEC, not implementation code.

Context:
- This is a new project (or module).
- No PHP code should be generated.
- No SQL migrations should be created.
- The output must be a specification document only.

Instructions:
1. Create a spec file describing the following domain:
   [DESCRIBE DOMAIN HERE]

2. The spec must:
   - Be written in clear, concise Markdown
   - Define entities, fields, and relationships
   - Avoid implementation details
   - Avoid PHP, SQL, or framework-specific code

3. The spec should be suitable to be placed under:
   `.agent/specs/`

4. Do NOT generate:
   - PHP classes
   - Repositories
   - Pages
   - Validators
   - SQL scripts

Output:
- A single Markdown spec document.
